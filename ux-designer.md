# UX Designer

The Daily Texan is shifting its focus to digital! We are looking for a talented user experience designer who wants to lead the transformation of the DT’s online experience. 

**What you can expect**
- A fast-paced, independent project: You’ll be working on creating wireframes and mockups for a new digital experience. This will include both low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity mockups, as well as some information architecture if you’re interested. 
- An 8-week commitment: This is a short commitment (9/15 – 11/10) but if you’d like to stay longer, you are definitely welcome to. 
- Flexible hours: You have complete control over when you work. Busy week? No problem. 
- A collaborative experience with mentorship: Work directly with and learn from the web director and a UI Designer
- A finished product: Add those mockups and writeups to your portfolio when you’re done


**What we’re looking for**
- You love good design but also think about technical specs
- You just feel when experiences are good, or bad. More than that, you can articulate why
- An online portfolio (or two-three previous work samples)
- Experience with creating wireframes and mockups 
- Experience with HTML/CSS 


**Nice-to-have's**
- Experience with Sketch

**Apply [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhhM-xPpvDqqYYzjx4B7Ylbt4BwlmvyP00x0k4Sbfpfx1Jng/viewform).** We’ll get in touch with you soon!
